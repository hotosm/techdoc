# Getting Started with HOT Technical Documentation
The brief version. For more details, check out the HOT documentation [landing page](home.md).

## Technical Documentation as an Analysis Tool
The kinds of documentation we are creating are not just "court reporting," but should be used as tools to think through and collaborate on the solution. Then, as a bonus for everyone, when the thinking and collaborating is done we also have a document for posterity, the future, and anyone who was not "in the room where it happened."

## Historians Wanted Also
That having been said, we have plenty of existing components that could use a little documentation love, so if you want to help, and practice your technical documentation skills, dive into any project and where you see gaps start drawing (or typing).

## Tools of the Trade
In terms of tooling, we use [LibreOffice Draw](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/draw/) as our primary design diagram tool and [LibreOffice Writer](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/) and [Github markdown pages](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github) for narrative. 

## I am all installed and ready to go, now what?
There are three levels of technical documentation we create. This quick start provides some examples, but for more you should return to the [landing page](home.md) and do more reading.
* For architecture design examples, check [Somewhere]().
* For detailed design examples, check [Somewhere]().
* For code-level design examples, check [Somewhere]().
