# A lack of technical documentation could result in future development and support issues
## Impact 
Without clear documentation, ramping up new developers, troubleshooting issues, and adding new features takes much longer. 
All of which slow progress and cost more.

## Severity 
CRITICAL
Severity of the risk on this scale: negligible, marginal, critical, catastrophic. 

## Likelihood
LIKELY
Likelihood of the risk on this scale: rare, unlikely, possible, likely, certain.

## Response 
Efforts are underway to put a documentation process, follow it to ensure documentation is in place for future projects and start filling gaps in historical projects
