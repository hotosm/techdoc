# Issues could arise because multiple HOT projects have different code bases for working with the same data and/or providing the same functionality
## Impact 
Cost of maintaining, supporting, and enhancing the code is higher.
Issues might be addressed and fixed in one project but missed in others.

## Severity 
MARGINAL
Severity of the risk on this scale: negligible, marginal, critical, catastrophic. 

## Likelihood
CERTAIN
Likelihood of the risk on this scale: rare, unlikely, possible, likely, certain.

## Response 
Potential changes required to other projects should be evaluated when a project is changed.
A roadmap is being put in place to create a common, shared code base.
