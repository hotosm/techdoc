# The Web UI in each project has a unique design (information architecture and visual design)
## Impact 
More complex user experience for users working across multiple HOT products may result in losing volunteers
More time spent designing UI and IA on a per HOT product basis may result in higher costs and less delivery

## Severity 
MARGINAL
Severity of the risk on this scale: negligible, marginal, critical, catastrophic. 

## Likelihood
POSSIBLE
Likelihood of the risk on this scale: rare, unlikely, possible, likely, certain.

## Response 
Plan in place to deploy a common UI information and design pattern across all HOT projects
