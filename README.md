This is the central documentation repository for the HOT project.

Project specific documentation can be found in the docs folder for the project. This the home of everything that does not belong to one specific project.

Here you can find:

## :star2: [Overarching Views of the Architecture](overarching-architecture)
Architecture views (and other documentation) that is not specific to one HOTSM application and applicable across multiple or all.

## :seedling: [Development Standards and Patterns](standards) 
Patterns and standards to guide development ncluding "How To" and "Getting Started" for developers

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: [The Architecture Decision Log](decisions)
A register of all the key architecture decisions for the HOTSM ecosystem, including some detail around why each was decided.

## :pencil2: [Guidance around HOT's documentation approach](https://github.com/hotosm/techdoc/wiki)
Get your pencil out! Guidance around around how HOT documents solutions.
