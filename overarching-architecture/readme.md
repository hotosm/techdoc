# Overarching Architecture Folder
While today HOT architecture consists of a wide range of applications and modules, the vision for the future is a more unified ecosystem. 

The key features of this architecture are:
* An integrated set of back-end modules
* A common data model based on standards and only extending as required
* Fit for purpose front-ends, built on REACT

Please refer to the [decisions](/decisions) log for details about HOT architecture decisions. 

## HOT Overarching View
This is an overarching view of the HOT ecosystem of solutions. It includes some key non-HOT components for context and because they serve an important role in the ecosystem.</br></br>

## Solution User View
This solution user view provides a user-centric view of the HOT architecture showing the key user roles and what activities they will perform using the solution. You can learn more about the diagram and notation [here](https://github.com/hotosm/techdoc/wiki/Architecture-Documents-Walkthrough#solution-user-diagram).<br/><br/>

## Information Flow
This information flow is a dynamic view that shows the flow of information (in high level business terms) between the HOT ecosystem components.You can learn more about the diagram and notation [here](https://github.com/hotosm/techdoc/wiki/Architecture-Documents-Walkthrough#information-flow).<br/><br/>

## Component Model
This component model is a static view that shows how the HOT ecosystem components connect to one another. You can learn more about the diagram and notation [here](https://github.com/hotosm/techdoc/wiki/Architecture-Documents-Walkthrough#component-model).<br/><br/>

## E2E Data Integration Diagrams
This is the high level concept for the E2E data integration approach. The TD Admin components in the center are not actually a hub instance, but a set of shared modules used for connectivity.

## E2E Integration Sequence Diagrams
These show the interactions between multiple components at a more detailed level.
