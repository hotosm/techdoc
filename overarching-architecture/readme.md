# Overarching Architecture Folder
While today HOT architecture consists of a wide range of applications and modules, the vision for the future is a more unified ecosystem. 

The key features of this architecture are:
* An integrated set of back-end modules
* A common data model based on standards and only extending as required
* Fit for purpose front-ends, built on REACT

Please refer to the [decisions](/decisions) log for details about HOT architecture decisions.
